/**
 * Component-level visual regression for the shared design system.
 *
 * These run in a real browser so the Tailwind utilities and the theme tokens
 * from `packages/assets/styles/` resolve exactly as they do in the app; a
 * jsdom run would report computed styles that never exist in production. That
 * matters here because the refactor moves components between generations of
 * the same concept (buttons, modals, selects) and the risk is a silent visual
 * change rather than a type error.
 *
 * Extends the package's own Vite config so the `#ui/*` alias and the SVG
 * loader behave the same as in the real build.
