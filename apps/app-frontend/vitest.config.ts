/**
 * Browser-mode component tests for the desktop app.
 *
 * These exist so overlay behaviour -- tooltips, popovers, menus -- can be
 * asserted rather than eyeballed. The app had no browser test runner before,
 * which meant `vite build` passing was the only automated signal, and that
 * says nothing about whether a tooltip appears in the right place: it proves
 * the module resolved, not that it works. Anything that positions itself
 * against the viewport needs a real layout engine, hence Chromium.
 *
 * The plugin and alias list is declared here rather than merged from
 * `vite.config.ts`, because that config exports a callback (it varies by
 * `command`) and `mergeConfig` cannot merge one. Only what a component test
 * needs is restated: the Vue plugin, the SVG loader that components import
 * `.svg?component` through, and the `@` alias.
